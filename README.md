# year2 stats graph plot
I wrote a script to save time when doing stats coursework in 2nd year of uni

I highlighy recommend you install WinPython from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.4/3.4.3.6/

(get the file named *WinPython-64bit-3.4.3.6Qt5.exe*)

### Requirements
* Python
* Matplotlib

But these requirements should be auto-installed with WinPython
